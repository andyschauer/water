# water
Start with Picarro's water isotope instrument .h5 files from a discrete injection system and end with VSMOW-SLAP calibrated values presented in an html report.

## What you need to do
After grabbing everything in this repository, edit the picarro_lib.py file according to your directory structure. Then, edit the reference_materials.json file according to the reference waters you have. 

## Not just for water
The picarro_h5.py as well as the instrument installed picarro_copy_h5_to_server.py can and should be used on other Picarro instruments. Let me now how it goes.

## Coming Soon
The ability to process data from a continuous flow analysis system is coming.
